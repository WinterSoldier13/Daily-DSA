-> points:
	(i) Read heavy system
	(ii) Billions of websites to store so prefer NoSQL
	(iii) user cache for more popular URLS
	(iv) URLs should have some expiration time
	(v) Use hash to create URL


Database:

USER: userID, email, passwordHash, lastActive
URL: customHash, originalURL, userID, creationTime, expiryTime
