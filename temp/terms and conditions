Load Balancer:
Load Balancer (LB) is another critical component of any distributed system. It
helps to spread the traffic across a cluster of servers to improve 
responsiveness and availability of applications, websites or databases.

Content Distribution Network (CDN)
CDNs are a kind of cache that comes into play for sites serving large amounts
of static media. In a typical CDN setup, a request will first ask the CDN for a 
piece of static media; the CDN will serve that content if it has it locally 
available. If it isnâ€™t available, the CDN will query the back-end servers for the 
file, cache it locally, and serve it to the requesting user.
