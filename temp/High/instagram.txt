-> User should be able to upload pictures/Videos
-> User should be able to see picture uploaded by others
-> User should be able to follow other people
-> User should be able to search for other poeple

-> It should be highly available
-> The latency should be less
-> It is okay if our system is eventually consistent

-> Ask for the user estimate 
-> 500KB pic + see database below

-> Add a gateway first
	-> redirect to different loadBalancer with different serevers
			-> Upload picture service
			-> Generate userFeed service
			-> Search service (Use elastic searcg)
			-> follow other people service

	-> good 2 have: Kafaka where you can direct information about what the user liked and also after creating a new profile add to elastic search db.

-> Database:
	USER : userID, name, email, dob, creationDate, lastLogin, isActive
	Photo: photoID, userID, photoStorageURL, geo_tag, timestamp
	UserFollow : UserId1, UserId2

	Expect to be read heavy so use masterslave

	Also you need to implement sharding... we can shard by location, but if it is night in India then the load on the Indian server will be a lot less while on the USA server it will be too much
	So better shard on userID.
