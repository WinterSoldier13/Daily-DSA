So, the real reason why I used MongoDB was that time was that I learned to use it recently
Moreover it was not like I was handing any ACID transactions in this project, so I really did not need SQL specifically
MongoDB also provided me with a free cloud storage MongoAtlas to connect my backend to.
And I feel like interacting with MongoDB in JS is easy, it's just like working with objects.



-> MongoDB stores everything as documents (ananlogous to rows in SQL) and each document contains fields(ananlogous to cols)


How MongoDB?

-> You define a schema
-> In the schema you define various fields with properites like is Null and the data type
-> Then you export an model of this schema
-> To use it you just create an instance, and then call methods on that instance


What kind of fields did your database had??

-> okay, so first because I was using Google Firebase for authentication so I did not needed any field to store user passwords
-> For the user, I store the Name, Enrollment Number and email.
-> For each professor, I store in which department he teaches, what subject he teaches, his ratings and total count of people who have rated, you know just to find the avg
-> For each professor I also store an array of comment IDs
-> Coming to the comment document, I store the Enrollment number, the string of the comment, and an auto generated time-stamp.
-> Although the Enrollment Number is not displayed on the frontend, but I still store it... you know to flag any inappropriate comments
